If you save this file as **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** in your repo root, GitHub will automatically show it when someone tries to create a Pull Request.  

Do you want me to also **make a short, professional `README` section** that links to both the Code of Conduct and Contributing Guidelines so people can find them easily?
